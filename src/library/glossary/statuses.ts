const AngryStatus = "Angered Navis are reckless and attack with all their might. \
While this status is active, Navis with it gain advantage on all Valor Checks. \
This includes Attack Rolls. They also add their Spirit to the result of Attack \
Rolls they make until the next time they land a hit against a target. This attack \
will deal double damage and cause the status to fade.";

const AuraStatus = "The Aura status surrounds Navis in a powerful cloak of energy that \
eliminates any attack weaker than it and grants immunity to the effects of Poison and \
Lava terrain. When a Navi is attacked while under the Aura status, any damage that is \
less than an amount specified by the aura's source is negated. Once the aura is hit \
with damage high enough to match or surpass this amount, it fades.";

const BarrierStatus = "Navis with the Barrier status are surrounded in a protective \
field that is able to absorb incoming attacks to prevent damage to the Navi. Barriers \
often have a capacity for damage that can be absorbed, and when this capacity is met \
or surpassed the status ends. Wind damage immediately removes this status.";

const BlindStatus = "When Blinded, all Attacks Rolls you make against targets \
at Near range and beyond are made with disadvantage and you automatically fail \
any Perception Check you're required to make. This includes Attack Rolls. \
When you are attacked from your Near range or further, the Attack Roll is made with advantage.";

const ConfusionStatus = "When Confused, you must make every Movement action available \
to you at the start of your turn. The direction you move in is determined by a roll \
of 1d6 and interpreted by your GM. You also immediately fail any Info Check you're \
required to make while this status is active. This includes Attack Rolls.";

const FatigueStatus = "Fatigued Navis are considered weak against every \
element. Further, when they expend Spirit Points, they must do so at \
twice the usual rate while following the same restrictions and have \
disadvantage on all Skill Checks."

const InvisibleStatus = "An Invisible target is unable to be seen through \
normal means. In combat, this will grant an increase to your AC until \
the status is removed. Out of combat, targets will need to make a \
Perception check with a DC equal to 10 plus twice your Body plus \
the bonus granted from the source of the status in order to \
detect your presence, but even then they may not be aware of \
your exact position. However, Cursor Element Navis have \
advantage on this Perception check and Cursor Element attacks ignore this boost to AC.";

const LockStatus = "When you become Locked, you are unable to \
make any Move Actions unless doing so would not change your \
position on the battlefield. You also immediately fail any \
Agility Check you're required to make. This includes Attack Rolls.";

const ParalysisStatus = "Paralysis prevents you from making any \
Movement or Attack actions on your turn. During this time, you \
will also immediately fail all Skill Checks that require Strength \
or Agility. Once the effect ends, you are unable to be Paralyzed \
again until after you take your next turn.";

const ShieldStatus = "Targets with the Shield status will often \
reduce the amount of damage received from incoming attacks. This \
can be a flat decrease or a direct reduction of the number of \
dice rolled to determine the damage of the attack. However, \
attacks that deal Break Element damage immediately remove the \
Shield status from targets and negate any of these effects.";

const StaggerStatus = "When Staggered, your AC is reduced by \
your Body Stat. You also immediately fail any Strength Check \
you're required to make. This includes Attack Rolls. This \
effect can be removed at the cost of all your remaining \
Move Actions for that round.";
